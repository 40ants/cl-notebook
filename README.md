### What's `cl-notebook`?

An in-browser editor for my own idiosyncratic use editing/presentation/etc use. Maybe it'll be useful to you too, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

### Usage

You need to install the [`house` server](https://github.com/Inaimathi/house), the [`fact-base` triple-store](https://github.com/Inaimathi/fact-base), [`cl-mop`](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-mop) and [this repo](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-notebook) by cloning them.

The rest of the dependencies are [quicklispable](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/), so you should then be able to hop into a lisp and do `(ql:quickload :cl-notebook)`.
