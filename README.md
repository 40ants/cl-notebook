### Dependencies

`alexandria`, `anaphora`, `cl-fad`, `closer-mop`, `optima`, `local-time`, `fact-base`, `house`

### Usage

You need to install the [`house` server](https://github.com/Inaimathi/house), the [`fact-base` triple-store](https://github.com/Inaimathi/fact-base) and [this repo](https://github.com/Inaimathi/cl-notebook) by cloning them.

The rest of the dependencies are [quicklispable](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/), so you should then be able to hop into a lisp and do `(ql:quickload :cl-notebook)`.

### TODO
##### Features (not necessarily in priority order)
######## Back-end
- Export HTML files
- Export .lisp files
- Build using buildapp?
- Branching for notebooks
- Add flag to single out cells that have changed since last being successfully evaluated
- Add cell dependencies (child cells get evaluated whenever the parent is evaluated)
- Figure out what to do about packages (thinking about defining a `:cl-notebook-user` that binds everything you need for basics and uses that in the running thread)

######## Front-end
- Really REALLY missing s-expression-based navigation. Look into it.
	- [`subpar`](https://github.com/achengs/subpar) exists, apparently
	- You... may need to roll your own s-exp navigation/deletion stuff here. Useful information:
		- `CodeMirror.runMode(byCellId(10, ".cell-contents").value, "commonlisp", function (token, type) { console.log(token, type)})` effectively tokenizes for you.
		- The CodeMirror matching paren mode might also be a good way to get s-expresison-related stuff happening
- Proper autocompletion (this may qualify as both front-end and back-end)
- Argument hints (again, both front and back-end)
- Better automatic indenting
- Better coloring
- front-end cleanup.
	- Possibly move it into a separate project?
	- Might want to annihilate some syntactic rough edges with a `defpsmacro` or two.
