### What's `cl-notebook`?

An in-browser editor for my own idiosyncratic use editing/presentation/etc use. Maybe it'll be useful to you too, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

### Usage

You need to install the [`house` server], the [`fact-base` triple-store] and [this repo] by cloning them.

The rest of the dependencies are [quicklispable], so you should then be able to hop into a lisp and do `(ql:quickload :cl-notebook)`.
